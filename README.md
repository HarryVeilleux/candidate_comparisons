Welcome to my first-ever R project! Right now (v1.0) all we have is a very small function (get_issues) that takes a url and html 
header as arguments and grabs all matching data from a webpage. After using get_issues to grab titles and text, I cleaned up the data 
and organized them into lists for each candidate (each named [first initial]_[last name]_issues_list). All other data in the
ma_third_candidates.RData file can be safely considered intermediary.

Goals:
1. Determine how to compare unique words between candidates' platforms
2. Finalize how to format the data to facilitate the comparison
3. Create a functional/readable/shareable report of analysis
4. Determine what steps in the process could be turned into functions
5. Create functions according to step 3
6. Pick another election district and test the full process

Thanks for reading! Sorry for the poor/lack of formatting; a sub-goal of mine is learning how to better format for readability/matching
conventions as I go along. All feedback is more than welcome.
